This pack was assembled using DarkAkuma's SFROMTool and patches, as well as Robin64's patch pack, and many patches and tweaks from romhacking, including many specifically made for Canoe by Sluffy. Their work is very much appreciated.

ALL 265 of these SFROMs work in Canoe. 

No Retroarch is required to play them!

Add them to your copy of HakchiCE as they are, add cover art, sync and play.
